/**
 * This class is a generic way of backing an Android ListView with a Firebase location.
 * It handles all of the child events at the given Firebase location. It marshals received data into the given
 * class type. Extend this class and provide an implementation of <code>populateView</code>, which will be given an
 * instance of your list item mLayout and an instance your class that holds your data. Simply populate the view however
 * you like and this class will handle updating the list as the data changes.
